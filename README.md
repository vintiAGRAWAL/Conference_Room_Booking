# Conference Room Booking System
## Working of the project:
This is a website made using HTML, CSS and PHP.
<br>
The user must first login/sign up into the website which leads them to the main booking page.
<br>
To book a room, the user must first specify the time for which the booking needs to be done which is followed by the number of members/capacity.
<br>
After entering the details, the user must press the "Book room" button to show if the changes that are made successfully.
<br>
On a successful booking they can then click on the "Pay now" button to proceed to the payment page. The details of the payment are filled and on completing the payment the user can proceed to logout or make a new booking.
<br>
The user can also check out our "About Page" for more info about us.
